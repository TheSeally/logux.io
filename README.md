## Development

You can build local version of website and open it in browser by:

```sh
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

You need manually to re-build it on every changes.

For layout HTML and CSS development you can use UI kit with auto re-build:

```sh
pnpm start:uikit
```

To test nginx config, you will need to build and run Docker image:

```sh
pnpx ssdeploy run
```
